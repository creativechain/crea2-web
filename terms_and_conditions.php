                        <p>4.1 Content filtering. Filtered out. We do not review all content loaded on the Services, but we may use available technologies, providers or processes to filter certain types of illegal content (for example, child pornography) or any other content or inappropriate behavior (for example, activity patterns that indicate spam or identity theft, as well as keywords that indicate that adult content has been published outside of the adult zone limits).</p>

                        <h4>5. Content that can be published in Creary</h4>
                        <p>In Creary you can post content that you create or possess that does not infringe the rights of others or is illegal or other content that you have permission to upload. This includes content in the public domain, Creative Commons or shared open source in accordance with the specific requirements of the license, and content protected by copyright in which you have legitimate permission from the owner. If you post something that you did not create yourself or that does not belong to you, you agree that you are responsible for any Content that you post; that it will only send Content that it has the right to publish; and that you will fully comply with the licenses of third parties related to the Content you post.</p>
                        <p>Creary is a platform for the distribution of Creative Portfolios and therefore does not allow the use of its platform for criminal, defamatory, degrading, immoral purposes or to promote the illegal consumption of narcotics, weapons or prostitution.</p>
                        <p>Creary has an option to be able to report the content or block all the publications of a user.</p>
                        <p>In the â€œCrea Blockchain" (Public and Distributed Database Technology where the Creary platform operates) all data is public and can be traced by authorities or third parties. In this way, the Creary development team, like any other person or public entity, will be able to detect users through their public key that they may be infringing or committing a crime related to that published content.</p>
                        <h4>6. IPFS file storage</h4>
                        <p>The Interplanetary File System (IPP) is a protocol and network designed to create a content-addressable peer-to-peer method for storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed file system. Creary uses this system to store the contents whether they are videos, audio, images or download files. Therefore Creativechain FDN does not store files in servers in a centralized way.</p>
                        <p>For this reason and unlike the metadata embedded in Crea's Blockchain, Creary does not guarantee 100% that content such as videos, audio, images or download files will be hosted on the network in perpetuity. Therefore we recommend that the user and owner of the work keep a copy of the original content to re-register or even be able to prove ownership to third parties using the original hash and the data recorded in the blockchain of Crea. The Creary service can set reasonable technical limits on the file size of each publication that is hosted on the IPFS network.</p>
                        <h4>7. Copyright and limited license</h4>
                        <p>Since the files are stored in the IPFS decentralized file network referred to in this section, we can retain data, text, photographs, images, video, audio, graphics, articles, comments, software, code, scripts and other content provided by us, the Blockchain of Crea or our licensors, which we call "Creary Content". This content is protected by the intellectual property laws in force in Spain and the European Union. Except as set forth in this Agreement and that provided by the authors by adding a distribution license to your work, we do not grant any express or implied right to use the Creary Content.</p>
                        <p>You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Service and Creary content for your personal use.</p>
                        <h4>8. Trademark policy</h4>
