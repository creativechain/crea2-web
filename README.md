# Crea 2.0 Web

Creativechain is a decentralized platform for the registration and distribution of content that certifies the authorship and license of any work or creation making them indelible. A tool for the empowerment of artists and all kinds of creative people who produce, share and distribute digital content. The platform applies the power of attorney of the revolutionary Blockchain technology in the process of registering content to create incorruptible time stamps that certify the intellectual property of any digital work. Creativechain incorporates all the advantages derived from the innovation of crypto coins. In this way, without the need to use bank accounts, purchases, micropayments or donations can be made to the authors of the registered contents. For the platform, creative chains are the ability of art and culture to interweave any kind of intellectual creation. When it is decided to use a copyleft licensed image to complete a new work of art, an invisible link is created that unites these two works forever. In that sense, the platform has been designed to strengthen the relationships that are generated in the processes of collective creation, therefore, any payment or donation can be chained to reward with a percentage to all the authors that are aligned in a creative chain.

When someone makes a payment to a work, a percentage is distributed to the entire chain of works that follow. In this way the payment or donation is extended in an "automagic" way to all the derivative works that have participated giving away part of its content.

If the innovative blockchain technology is used in Bitcoin to certify monetary transactions, in Creativechain it is used to certify content registrations (distribution licenses, smart contracts, metadata or files). This technological adaptation makes it possible for the first time in history to create a content distribution system that is decentralized, public, transparent, traceable, incorruptible and free code.

Creativechain is a bet for the public benefit of free culture and common creation as a collaborative method of growing and guaranteeing the right to culture.
