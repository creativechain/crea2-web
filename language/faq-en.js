In many cases the business is to sell the user's data to third parties that offer advertising. The beneficiaries are only a few.",
                "At Creary, we believe that the power and benefits of our ecosystem should be distributed among all users that add value to the network. 100% of the tokens issued by the network are distributed among all its users. The reward distribution system is governed by the community itself and any user can vote freely and in real time how they want the Crea network to evolve."

                "Vesting: CGY holders will receive as a reward 15% of the total rewards bag. If you do not move your CGY you will be rewarded with this percentage since the protocol considers that you are a user that participates and believes in the project.",
